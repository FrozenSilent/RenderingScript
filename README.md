# RenderingScript
 Some useful rendering scripts used in Blender (2.79 or 2.8) and Keyshot.

 ## Blender 2.7
 The scripts can produce the rendered images similar with the ShapeNetRendering dataset from [3D-R2N2](https://github.com/chrischoy/3D-R2N2) with camera parameters.

 ## Blender 2.8
 Render the model with shadow.

 ## Keyshot
 The scripts are used in the console of [Keyshot](https://www.keyshot.com/).

 ## Others
 Some scripts are borrowed from [3D-R2N2](https://github.com/chrischoy/3D-R2N2), [BlenderToolBox](https://github.com/HTDerekLiu/BlenderToolbox), and Keyshot official scripts.
