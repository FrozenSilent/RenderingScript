# RenderingScript
 Some useful rendering scripts used in Blender (2.79 or 2.8) and Keyshot.

 ## Blender 2.8
 The model from [3D-FUTURE](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/specials/promotion/alibaba-3d-future) is used as the demonstration example, and the rendering code comes from [BlenderToolBox](https://github.com/HTDerekLiu/BlenderToolbox) with some modifications.

 ## Keyshot
 The scripts are used in the console of [Keyshot](https://www.keyshot.com/).
